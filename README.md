# Hello everybody! Welcome to the React version of my original portfolio.

In this repository you can expect to find lots of source files including **HTML** and **Markdown** files that contain information about the website as well as the website's structure! There are also CSS and image files that are within other parts of the repo such as the resources folder and static folder!

This website contains my personal portfolio, or a draft of what is to become my personal portfolio. It was originally made with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but now I am transforming it into a _React_ project to include some animation!

You can access the current status of my portfolio here: https://wills-projects.github.io/!
